```

### 2. Install Dependencies

We use `npm` to manage our packages. Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

The contact form uses Web3Forms. To get it working, you'll need to provide your own access key.

Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add your key:

```env
# Get your free access key from https://web3forms.com/

```

*Note: I've updated the contact form to use this environment variable for you.*

### 4. Run the Development Server

You're all set! Start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
